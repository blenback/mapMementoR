Ensure your GPX file contains track points (`<trkpt>`) - Check file isn't corrupted - Try re-exporting from your GPS device/app  ### Missing Map Features  **Problem**: Some streets/water aren't showing - The script caches OpenStreetMap data in `data/*.rds` files - Delete these files to re-fetch fresh data - Ensure you have internet connection when first running  ### Color Not Appearing  **Problem**: Route color looks wrong - Check hex code format (`#` followed by 6 characters) - Ensure code is in quotes: `\"#d1af82\"` - Try increasing contrast with background  ### Font Issues  **Problem**: Text not appearing or wrong font - The default font is \"Outfit-VariableFont_wght\" - Ensure font files are in your `fonts/` directory - Or change `font_family` to a system font like \"Arial\" or \"Helvetica\"  ## Tips for Best Results  1. **GPX Quality**: Use tracks with good GPS signal for smooth routes 2. **Test Styles**: Try 2-3 color schemes to see what works best 3. **Print Tests**: Print at small size first to check colors 4. **Location Names**: Use clear, short names for better layout 5. **Multiple Entries**: The map beautifully shows progression over multiple years  ## Example Workflow  ```r # 1. Get your race data save_powerof10_to_yaml(   first_name = \"Your\",   surname = \"Name\",   club = \"Your Club\",   event = c(\"HM\", \"Mar\") )  # 2. Add GPX files to data/ folder # 3. Edit the generated YAML to add gpx_file paths  # 4. Create maps with all styles create_race_series(   races_path = \"your_name_races.yaml\",   styles_path = \"styles.yaml\",   output_dir = \"my_maps\" )  # 5.
